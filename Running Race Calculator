# Running altitude and elevation calculator
# I am an avid marathon run and live in Colorado. I was trying to find a clear way of estimating my equivalent pace at sea level and at different slopes
# I couldnt find an online source that both of these factors so I found the rough formulas and can now plug in my running stats and get my equivalent pace for a different race / location
# + 23 s / % grade / % mile for uphill
# -11 s / % grade / % mile for downhill
#Jack and Jill is an average of -1.45% grade (-18 s / mile) (goal race in Washington)
